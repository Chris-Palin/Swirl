    Significant applications and design features:
    
    What is a GUI?
    A GUI (Graphic User Interface) is a graphical representation in which the users can interact with software or devices through graphical icons.
    
    What is CLI ?
    A CLI (Command Line Interface) is a console or text based representation in which the user types the commands to operate the software or devices.
      
    GUI vs. CLI:
    
    Ease:
    New users will pick up a GUI much faster than a CLI. In a CLI, new users have some difficulty operating it because they are not familiar with the commands.
    
    Control:
    With a GUI, there’s control over files and the operating system – but advanced tasks may still need to use the command line.
    With a CLI, users have all the control over file system and operating system, and the tasks become simple. For example, you can copy a file or several with one command.
    
    Speed:
    If we talk about speed, in a GUI, using the mouse and the keyboard to control the file system or the operating system is going to be slower than using the command line.
    In a CLI, the users only need to utilise the keyboard and may need to execute only few commands to complete the task.

"Caption": """
    Software license:
    A software license is a legal instrument (usually by way of contract law, with or without printed material) governing the use or redistribution of software.
    
    Site License:
    
    A site license is a type of software license that allows the user to install a software package in several computers simultaneously, such as at a particular site (facility) or across a corporation. Depending on the amount of fees paid, the license may be unlimited or may limit simultaneous access to a certain number of users. The latter is called a concurrent site license.
    
    Creative Commons License:
    A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created.
    
    Shareware:
    Shareware is software that you can use on a trial basis before paying for it. Unlike freeware, shareware often has limited functionality or may only be used for a limited time before requiring payment and registration. Once you pay for a shareware program, the program is fully functional and the time limit is removed. In the 1980s and 1990s, shareware was a popular way for small developers to distribute software. The advent of CDs allowed multiple developers to deliver their software programs as a collection, such as "Top 100 Mac Games." Other shareware collections included utilities, graphics programs, and productivity applications.
    
    
    Freeware:
    Freeware is software that is free to use. Unlike commercial software, it does not require any payment or licensing fee. It is similar to shareware, but will not eventually ask you for payment to continue using the software. You can legally download and use freeware for as long as you want without having to pay for it. Many types of software programs are offered as freeware, including games, utilities, and productivity applications. You might wonder what incentive developers have to create freeware programs?
    
    Public domain software:
    Public domain software is software that is not protected by a copyright and so there is no particular owner or the author has given up ownership rights, leaving the software available for everyone for use. Linux is an example of public domain software.
    
    Open Source software:
    Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
    
    Intellectual property:
    Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
    IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.
    
    Copyright:
    Is a bunch of rights in certain creative works such as computer programs, sound recordings and films. The rights are granted exclusively to the copyright owner to reproduce the material, and for some material, the right to perform or show the work to the public. Copyright owners can prevent others from reproducing or communicating their work without their permission or may sell these rights to someone else. Copyright does not protect ideas, concepts, styles or techniques. For example, copyright will not protect an idea for a film or book, but it will protect a script for the film or even a storyboard for the film..
